## Making Contributions ‚ù§Ô∏è

1. Fork the repository
2. We use uv as our python project manager. To learn how to install uv visit [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/). After downloading uv create a .venv using `uv venv`
3. Install dependencies by running `uv pip install -r pyproject.toml`. Alternatively if you don't want to use uv you
can run `pip install -e ".[dev]"`
4. Create a new branch for your feature: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
5. Make your changes
6. Run tests: via `uv run pytest` or `python -m pytest tests/`
7. Lint and clean your code using 
```
uv tool install ruff (one time only)
uvx ruff check 
uvx ruff clean
uvx ruff format
```
8. Submit a PR with a clear description of your changes
